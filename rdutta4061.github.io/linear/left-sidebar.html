								<h2>What I want to do in life...</h2>
								<span class="byline">This is a short life story about my passion for nature and technology.</span>
							</header>
							<p>My name is Rishith Dutta i’m a rising senior at Enloe High School. This is about the things I like to learn about the most, which is Nature and technology, but my favorites are animals and insects, herpetology (reptiles/amphibians). I have two dogs, a golden retriever and a golden doodle. Over the past 6 years i’ve had lizards, geckos, frogs, toads, tadpoles, beetles, spiders, and pretty much any common animal/insect you can name… I aspire to go into the field of biotechnology; my goal is to utilize nature in a way that can effectively help humanity. Whether that be through a medical discovery, pyschological break through or hopefully through robotic. Nonetheless I am prepared to dedicate my life to the field. I hope to utilize “necrobotics” to further advance the field of biorobotics. In essence it’s the use of deceased insects or animals in order to make a mechanical contraption that is of use to us humans. I intend to embark on a self-initiated project in necro robotics using a Wolf spider. Sounds creepy, I know. But my plan is to use a dead spider and utilize its amazing leg strength to lift up objects of sorts, and with precision. Believe it or not a spider can actually lift up to 173 times their body weight, or about 80g, (give or take the size of the spider.) If we can utilize the relative strength of a spider and convert the strength into human proportions then we could potentially enable a person to lift 8,650 lbs just by using their arms. As you imagine this could be implemented into various professions in the world. I hope we can use it in rescue missions such as with firefighters lifting up heavy debris, police assisting in a crash or even by the military in war conflicts or hopefully for mechanical uses. I beleive that nature has intrinsic value to humans, and that we should feel inspired by the design of nature to assist the success of our species. Aside from all the practical uses animals have, I also believe that they are the most moral and ethical entities in the world. For example a human can be considered immoral as soon as 3 months old. For instance we already start “lying” from the moment we learn how to cry. As a baby we “fake” cry in order to get what we want, whether that be food, milk or affection from our parents. As innocent as it seems, in reality it still is an example of lying and thereby not morally conformative. And as we all know, as we age into young adulthood the extravagance of our lies multiply’s to infinity. Of course this varies from person to person, but in general the consensus is that we tend to increase the frequency and severity of our lies to our intentions. For example we lie about important things, such as money or unprecedented relationships to our spouses, or even little white lies such as lying about our favortite type of music in order to fit in with our friends. Nonetheless a lie is still a lie. I used a lie as just one of the immoral things we as humans do. But obviously we do much worse than lie. For example we kill, steal and abandon our friends not to mention our own family. But you see animals except the highly intelligent ones suchs as apes, monkeys, whales, and other unusually high intellect organisms - are for the most part completely innocent and “safe” from the immoralities of our capabilities. Animals are incapable of lying or performing actions in order to gain something of no essential value (e.g money, big houses, etc. ) and more importantly they dont have an inetention of violence in them. The only violence they’re capable of is the type that their inherent instincts enable them to. Such as a dog biting and snapping at you when you try to take their food. They aren't biting you just because they can or because they “want” to hurt you; instead they bite you because it is an instinctive reflex built into them from 1000s of years of experience in other animals stealing their much needed food in order to survive in the wild. I say this because the fact that animals are “pure” beings, I can confidently say that I have no problem in dedicaitng my life toward research of them. &nbsp;</p>
